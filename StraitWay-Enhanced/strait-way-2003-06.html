        <h2>Overseeing The Flock: Part Six - The Elder's Wife</h2>

        <p>We read the qualifications of the office of a bishop and the qualifications of a deacon in <span class="scripture-ref">1st Timothy 3:1-10</span>. As we read further, in verse 11 it says, "Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things." I personally think it is talking about the wives of both the bishop and the deacon.</p>

        <p>We must keep in mind as we read about the qualifications of the elder, that he is to be the husband of one wife. His wife is exactly that, a wife. By being an elder's wife she has not inherited an office. She has not inherited some special work. She is not obligated to do special things or to live in a special way apart from other Christian women.</p>

        <p>Although God does not set the elder's wife apart from other Christian wives or women, that is not to say she is not set apart by many brothers and sisters in Christ. For example, can you even imagine the reaction the elder's wife would receive if she wore the same type clothes as some of the sisters?</p>

        <p><span class="scripture-ref">1st Timothy 3</span> says she is to be grave, not a slanderer, sober, and faithful in all things. <span class="scripture-ref">Titus 2:3-5</span> teaches she is to behave as becomes holiness, not a false accuser, not be given to much wine, a teacher of good things. <span class="scripture-ref">Proverbs 31</span> is a good example of how an elder's wife should conduct herself.</p>

        <p>As you have already noticed, the qualifications given in the passages above are passages that apply to all Christian wives. Yes, the elder's wife is to behave in such a manner as becometh holiness, but so are ALL our sisters in Christ.</p>

        <h2>Preacher Training: The Work of Writing</h2>

        <p>In <span class="scripture-ref">Galatians 6:11</span> Paul mentions that he was writing this letter with his own hand, i.e. personally rather than dictated and transcribed. In <span class="scripture-ref">2 Timothy 4:13</span>, Paul's last written correspondence that we know of, he makes request for his cloak, his books, and his parchments. By these verses as well as the fact that the Holy Spirit made use of Paul's talents to pen half the books of the New Testament, we might draw the conclusion that writing was a definite part of the apostle's ministry.</p>

        <p>If there is one complaint that I have heard over the years, echoed and re-echoed, it is that we don't have enough written materials to assist in our teaching and study. We don't have enough curriculum material, not enough tracts for teaching, and certainly not enough adult reading and study material.</p>

        <p>The young man in training needs to be practicing his writing skills. A few suggestions that might help develop this skill:</p>

        <p><strong>1) Discipline.</strong> One should set aside some time to write on a daily, or at least a weekly basis.</p>

        <p><strong>2) Assignments.</strong> The young man should be assigned topics that will make him be concise, well studied, and accurate.</p>

        <p><strong>3) Limits.</strong> There needs to be a word limit to the articles. Practice boiling down the points and getting to the subject.</p>

        <p><strong>4) Reading.</strong> A regular practice of reading good, uplifting literature will assist one in broadening vocabulary and knowledge.</p>

        <h2>Erroneous Concepts Of The Church</h2>

        <p>In <span class="scripture-ref">Matthew 16:18</span>, Jesus said, "...I will build my church...." According to Acts chapter two, that promise was fulfilled on the first Pentecost after the resurrection of Christ. What is your concept of the church revealed in the New Testament?</p>

        <p><strong>One modern concept of the Church of Christ is that it is made up of all churches.</strong> Why reject this concept? Many of these churches wear names which you cannot read in your Bible. Many teach doctrines which are not taught in the word of God. They foster a state of religious division which is not pleasing to God.</p>

        <p><strong>Another modern concept is that it is made up only of local congregations</strong>—there being no universal body which is made up of all saved people. Why reject this concept? Jesus said, "...I will build my church..." and the church is called the body of Christ (<span class="scripture-ref">Mt. 16:18; Eph. 1:22,23</span>). There is just one body (<span class="scripture-ref">Eph. 4:4,5</span>), therefore there is just one church. According to Paul, men are baptized into that one body (<span class="scripture-ref">I Cor. 12:13</span>).</p>

        <p>When the eunuch was baptized by Philip (<span class="scripture-ref">Acts 8:36-40</span>) he was not baptized into a local church for they were in a place "...which is desert" (<span class="scripture-ref">Acts 8:26</span>). The eunuch was baptized into the universal body of Christ.</p>

        <h2>Coming "In the Clouds"</h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p>BEHOLD, HE IS COMING WITH THE CLOUDS, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the earth will mourn over Him. So it is to be. Amen. (<span class="scripture-ref">Rev. 1:7</span>)</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The term coming "with the clouds" or "in the clouds" is used throughout the Bible as a symbol of the judgment of God. It is used in <span class="scripture-ref">Isa. 19:1; Ezek. 30:3; 32:7</span> to describe God's judgment against Egypt. It is used in <span class="scripture-ref">Matthew 24:24-30</span> to describe God's judgment against Jerusalem.</p>

        <p><strong>Every Eye Shall See.</strong> In the final judgment, all who have rejected Christ, persecuted His church, and turned their backs on Him will see Him. Remember, every knee will bow (<span class="scripture-ref">Phil. 2:9-11</span>). Some will bow to Him for His glory; and the majority will bow before Him to their own damnation.</p>

        <p>This passage also presents a dilemma for the premillennialist who insists of a "secret return" of Jesus. Nothing is indicated in this passage that His return will be secret! ALL WILL KNOW—which parallels <span class="scripture-ref">2 Thess. 4:16-17; Acts 1:9-11</span>.</p>

        <p>There will be some who mourn His return! To "mourn" indicates the "beating of the head or breast in lamentation, suggesting a condition of utter hopelessness." Not everyone will be joyous when the Lord returns! Are you prepared for His return?</p>

        <h2>"Home": Needs A "Real" Woman</h2>

        <p>This month our study continues with a look at woman, the counterpart of man. Remember, there is a difference in male and female, God made them different (<span class="scripture-ref">Gen 1:27</span>).</p>

        <p>The second greatest breakdown in the home and family, I believe, is the abdication of the woman from her God given role. However, just being "female" is no guarantee that a woman is the kind of woman God wants. To illustrate, notice the contrast between two women from Proverbs.</p>

        <p><strong><span class="scripture-ref">Proverbs 7:5-27</span> describes a "strange woman":</strong> Has the attire of a harlot; is subtle (crafty or deceptive) of heart; loud, stubborn – won't stay at home; and only interested in the gratification of the flesh. The writer concludes her house is the way to hell.</p>

        <p><strong><span class="scripture-ref">Proverbs 31:10-31</span> describes a "virtuous" woman:</strong> Can be trusted; is not lazy; works diligently; is charitable; supports her husband behind the scenes; is wise and kind. Her concern is for inner strength and beauty. Her primary concern is the needs of her husband and household.</p>

        <p>Just as masculinity is more than just being a male, so femininity is more than just being a female. The "real" woman is not the one who can assert herself in such a way as to attract attention, but the one who embodies the qualities God desires.</p>
