        <h2>Overseeing The Flock: Part Five - Preaching That Demands Change</h2>

        <p>Elders are to demand the word be preached. Paul told Timothy to "preach the word" (<span class="scripture-ref">2nd Tim. 4:2</span>). The word demands change in one's life. It demands change to become more like Christ, and to live a righteous and godly life. Truth is, if a congregation can sit in the pew week after week and never feel a need to change anything in their life, they are not hearing the gospel preached. The gospel of Christ is demanding.</p>

        <p>In these times, many will not endure sound doctrine (<span class="scripture-ref">2nd Tim. 4:3</span>). They do not want to feel the prick of the sword as it exposes their sin and demands change in their life. They want change, but not according to the gospel. They want to change the church to be more like the world.</p>

        <p>In his book, "Piloting The Strait", Dave Miller talked about how the cultural change in the last 30 years is affecting the church. He said, "The church has not eluded the clutches of this social circumstance... hurricane force winds of change are pounding down upon the body of Christ."</p>

        <p>As we see many denominations move to a more relaxed atmosphere in their worship we can see it also affecting many in the Lord's church. Many are beginning to dress more casual, and casual dress leads to casual worship. Many want more "stories" and less scripture in the sermons preached. Entertainment is the order of the day instead of book, chapter and verse.</p>

        <p>Elders must demand preaching that will urge us to "...examine ourselves whether we be in the faith" (<span class="scripture-ref">2nd Cor. 13:5</span>). We must ask ourselves if we have truly been converted from the world.</p>

        <h2>Preacher Training: Personal Work</h2>

        <p>Since the church growth "bust" that crossed denominational and church lines in the seventies, personal work has acquired a reputation for itself that is truly 'underwhelming.' Brethren lack interest in it, classes on it come and go, and even some preachers have almost given up on it.</p>

        <p>It is sad that this skill has fallen out of favor with so many, because as I think back over a quick 28 years of gospel preaching it is not necessarily the "easy" responses during gospel meetings and persuasive sermons that I remember. My richest memories are stuck on those whose homes I was in night after night. To struggle with Satan over those souls and win... those victories are victories indeed and the relationships formed are lifetime relationships.</p>

        <p><strong>How shall this be done?</strong> It starts with an attitude like Jesus had. If one does not truly care about people, whatever situation of life they are found in, then he is in the wrong business. The young preacher in training needs to "shadow" the local preacher (or elder) for several months just to watch and learn.</p>

        <p>He also needs to have some organized material that he is prepared and ready to teach. Asking for a class is one thing, but what happens when the serious prospect says, "sure, I'll study"?</p>

        <p>Basically it takes three things to be successful at personal work: <strong>Preparation</strong> (working with someone and developing some lessons), <strong>Personality</strong> (learning how to be warm and friendly without giving the 'salesman' image), and <strong>Patience</strong> (both in setting up studies and in seeing them through to the conclusion).</p>

        <h2>Passing The Sword: First Timothy Chapters 3-4</h2>

        <p><strong>Chapter Three:</strong> Paul begins this chapter by telling Timothy what the qualifications of elders in a congregation of God's people should be. Timothy, as well as Titus (<span class="scripture-ref">Titus 1:5</span>), are to be involved in the appointment of elders.</p>

        <p>In verse 16, we see the preservation of the pure gospel and the One who revealed it. There are six clauses in this verse that depict the true godliness of Christ: (1) Christ being manifested in the flesh. (2) He was raised and thereby vindicated as truly the Son of God. (3) Angels saw Him after His resurrection. (4) The Gospel was preached to both Jews and Gentiles. (5) This message was proclaimed throughout the whole world during Paul's lifetime. (6) He ascended back into heaven.</p>

        <p><strong>Chapter Four:</strong> This chapter starts out with discussing the forthcoming evils of which Timothy was to be aware. False teachers and false doctrines will arise. The way that Timothy could counteract these false teachers and doctrines would be for him to continually and repetitively speak the truth and live accordingly. In order for him to be able to do this, he must give himself over to study, reading, and learning.</p>

        <h2>The Well-Spring of Love</h2>

        <p><span class="scripture-ref">I Corinthians 13</span> is the love chapter of the Bible. In verses 4-8, are listed several things which love does and does not do. Each of us would profit rereading I Corinthians 13:4-8. Rather than reading "charity" or "love" substitute "I." "I" suffer long and am kind; "I" envy not... etc.</p>

        <p>Have you ever wondered how we can do the things that love does? Consider <span class="scripture-ref">I Timothy 1:5</span> where Paul said, "Now the end (purpose) of the commandment is charity (love) out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned..." The purpose of the law of God is to produce love. That this love can only be produced where there are three things—a pure heart, a good conscience, and an unfeigned faith.</p>

        <p><strong>First, the pure heart.</strong> Take a man with a pure heart and inject him with a good dose of "envy." Can an envious person love his neighbor?</p>

        <p><strong>Second, the good conscience.</strong> When the heart is instructed by the word of God and we keep a good conscience we will always do that which is right toward all men.</p>

        <p><strong>Third, faith unfeigned.</strong> "Unfeigned" is without hypocrisy. An unfeigned faith says, what does God say for me to do? That is what I will do!</p>

        <h2>"Home": Needs A "Real" Man</h2>

        <p>One of the greatest problems with homes today is that many do not have a man in them at all and in those who do have, the man is not a "real" man. Both <span class="scripture-ref">Ezek. 22:30</span> and <span class="scripture-ref">Jer. 5:1</span> talk about looking for a man among God's people and not being able to find one. Were there only females among God's people at this time? Certainly not, there were plenty of males, but God was looking for a "real" man.</p>

        <p>Remember, in the beginning, God made them male and female (<span class="scripture-ref">Gen. 1:27</span>). So, there is a difference in physical makeup, but it takes more than just the physical makeup to be a man like God wants. In <span class="scripture-ref">Gen. 3:16</span> God specifically said to Eve, "thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee." God gave to man the role of leadership or headship, and men, in general, in our society have "thrown in the towel" in regard to this God given role.</p>

        <p>There were men in the Bible who had everything physically, but they were weak in character. Being a "real" man involves more than physical attributes—it requires spiritual strength, moral courage, and faithful leadership.</p>
