          <h2>Overseeing The Flock — Part Seven</h2>
          <h3>(Working with the evangelist)</h3>
          <p>God made a distinction between the evangelist and the pastor, <span class="scripture-ref">"And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers." (Eph. 4:11)</span>. The elders must not "dump" their work upon the evangelist, and the evangelist must not take over the work of the elders. They should be supportive of each other.</p>
          <p>When a preacher is doing a good work, the congregation should readily see that he has the full support of the eldership. It is very appropriate, from time to time, for one of the elders to stand before the congregation and commend the work of a sound preacher. And, if the elders are doing their work properly, the preacher should make it very clear that he is supportive of them.</p>
          <p>However, if the eldership sees something they are concerned about in the work of the preacher they should go directly to him, not anyone else. It is unfair and to be anything less than honest with the preacher about what the elders may perceive as a problem with him or the work he is doing. It is during this type discussion that the elders should be very careful not to discourage the preacher. The elders should certainly have the right attitude and be mindful of how they present the problem to the preacher. This will determine whether the end result will be positive or not. Likewise, the preacher should also talk to the elders in private about any problem he may have concerning them. He should never use the pulpit to air problems he has with the elders.</p>
          <p>Elders and preachers must always keep in mind that their ultimate responsibility is to God. It is sad there seems to be some preachers that are nothing more than hired hands. They are very careful to preach only the things they think will please the elders and the congregation as a whole. They fear if they preach certain things that needs preaching, they may be fired or cause some to leave. It is under these circumstances that the whole counsel of God fails to be preached. God's man will listen to the suggestions of the elders and the congregation about things they suggest needs to be preached, but will never fail to <span class="scripture-ref">"Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine." (2nd Tim. 4:2)</span>.</p>
          <p>When meeting with a preacher to determine whether he will come work with a congregation or not, some preachers may resent being asked certain questions. Some will compare questioning them to a creed or such like. But, how will the elders know where the man stands concerning truth if they don't ask him? A sound preacher will welcome the opportunity to let elders, and everyone else, know where he stands concerning truth and the issues facing the church. This is also a time for the preacher to determine if he will be able to peaceably work with this eldership. As one preacher once told me, "Sometimes certain preachers and congregations just don't mesh."</p>
          <p>It is God's plan for each local congregation to have elders <span class="scripture-ref">(Acts 14:23)</span>. The relationship between the evangelist and the eldership is a very important one and will determine the direction of the work of a congregation. If the relationship is based upon biblical direction and principles, it will work. And, if the preacher and the eldership are on the same page, the congregation will not split every time a problem arises.</p>

          <h2>Preacher Training</h2>
          <h3>The Work of Study</h3>
          <p>I have addressed this area of the preacher's work in the fashion above, i.e. as a "work" because that is exactly what it is, work. A quick glance through Paul's letters to Timothy will bring home the point to us that study is a necessary part of the preachers efforts. The apostle told that 'intern' to "pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching" <span class="scripture-ref">(1 Tim. 4:16)</span>; "Be diligent (study, KJV) to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth" <span class="scripture-ref">(2 Tim. 2:15)</span>; "…from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation" <span class="scripture-ref">(2 Tim. 3:15)</span>, and of course, "All scripture is inspired by God and profitable… so that the man of God may be adequate (complete, KJV) equipped for every good work" <span class="scripture-ref">(2 Tim. 3:16-17)</span>. Read these admonitions and reminders again and try to deny that the effectiveness and faithfulness of a gospel preacher is going to be dependent upon study!</p>
          <p>A common mistake that young preachers and other Christians make is thinking that a gospel preacher is some kind of denominational pastor. Even though we deny it, our actions often speak louder than our words. We act like the preacher is the social director, the youth minister, and the appointed hospital/nursing home visitor. While elders busy themselves with "real jobs" or about their home if they are of retirement age, preachers run all over town calling and visiting and seeing to needs in the flock. Who is the "real" pastor I've got to ask? Who's really checking on the sheep? It ought to be an embarrassment for elders to need the preacher to keep them informed of what's going on in the church… for two reasons.</p>
          <p>First, THAT'S NOT HIS JOB. He is a teacher, NOT a shepherd. Seeing to the needs of the sheep is the shepherd's job. Anyone, in any field, who sits back and hands his job to another to do would be called a slackard. Well? Tell me again why the church is suffering so in our culture.</p>
          <p>Secondly, because he's doing someone else's job, HE'S NOT DOING HIS OWN WORK. How can he obey the admonitions of Paul in the passages above when he is not allowed time in his office to sit and pray and study and meditate? How can there be any spiritual depth to lessons that are thrown together because the preacher was running all over town or organizing get-togethers for the church? What level of learning will our classes have when the preacher never has the time to really develop and research the text being studied?</p>
          <p>One part of every training program that I have been part of was making it clear that he had definite "office hours." One reason was because the average Christian is out working 40-50 hours a week and they needed to know that the preacher is not lazy. The other, more important reason however, was that I wanted the young man to get in the habit of studying. I explained that I wanted him to have quiet time when he could pray over his studies. I wanted him to think about what he was saying, and why, and to who, and what effect it was going to have. Young men need to get in the habit of research.</p>
          <p>One 'intern' had already been preaching for two years before he took on the task of working with me. He confided that in two years he had never written a lesson "from scratch". He got his lessons off the internet. That young man, who was and is a fine preacher by the way, subsequently lost his computer privileges when it came to preaching. He had to find a pencil and write EVERYTHING for awhile. After complaining how hard it was, he later thanked me for the difference it made.</p>
          <p>Churches or elders who oversee training programs should demand certain hours per week of the young preacher to be spent in his office, not make demands that would pull him away. There should be assignments on contemporary issues as well as historic ones that will make the man dig for information and show his progress. Please note that I am certainly not opposed to preachers who visit and we must at times call on the members to develop relationships. I'm simply saying that the most important foundation stone of the preacher's faith and work is accurate knowledge. And that cannot be gained without time in the study.</p>

        <article class="article" id="godly-husband">
          <h2>"Home" Needs A Godly Husband</h2>
          <p>Earlier we discussed the need for a "real" or godly man in the home. In this study we want to address the husband as the term is used in <span class="scripture-ref">1 Pet. 3:7</span>. Holman's Bible Dictionary defines "husband" as: "The male partner in a marriage." Easton's Dictionary has: "I. e. the 'house-band' connecting and keeping together the whole family." From the above we understand that the "husband" is a male and has particular and specific responsibilities in the home. As emphasized in these studies, the home begins with one male and one female united together in marriage for life <span class="scripture-ref">(Gen 1:24,25)</span>. <span class="scripture-ref">1 Pet 3:7</span> says the husband is to dwell with his wife according to knowledge; a knowledge of what is right; i.e., God's will.</p>
          <p>The husband is given the responsibility of "headship" <span class="scripture-ref">(Ephesians 5:23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.)</span> Certainly, God did not make woman (the wife) a slave <span class="scripture-ref">(Eph 5:22-25)</span>. Yes, there is submission, but you will notice in the same chapter, the husband is to love his wife as himself (vs. 28,29) and Paul points out that no one hates his own flesh but nourishes and cherishes it. The husband is to nourish and cherish his wife. "Nourish" means to take care of and "cherish" means to warm or make warm. The husband, then, is to take care of his wife and furnish her the things necessary and be vitally concerned with her welfare as well as doing his best to make their relationship what it ought to be.</p>
          <p>The husband is given the responsibility of "provider". He must provide leadership which must be in a home separate from his and her parents <span class="scripture-ref">(Gen 2:24; Matt 19:4-6)</span>. Serious problems result when either parents fail to turn loose the oversight or children fail to turn loose of their parent's security. He must provide for her physical needs, her financial security <span class="scripture-ref">(Gen 3:19; 1 Tim 5:8)</span>. He must provide for her sexual needs <span class="scripture-ref">(1 Cor 7:1-4)</span>. She is not just his "toy" or "plaything", but his wife, and he must be concerned about her needs even above his. He provides for her spiritual needs. The idea of teaching and training is involved in the words "nourish" and "cherish" in <span class="scripture-ref">Eph 5:29</span>. He must, as much as is physically possible, provide protection from danger.</p>
          <p>The apostle Paul makes this role of "provider" very clear when he says: <span class="scripture-ref">"But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel." (1 Tim. 5:8)</span></p>
          <p>Husbands have the responsibility of gentleness. Ruggedness is often thought of as synonymous with masculinity and gentleness with femininity. So, some men avoid being gentle, but think of the term "gentleman". Gentleness is a God-like quality. Jesus demonstrated the strength of gentleness <span class="scripture-ref">(1 Pet. 2:21-25)</span>. Meekness is a twin of gentleness <span class="scripture-ref">(2 Tim 2:24,25; Titus 3:2)</span>. It is strength or power under control. Tenderness and affection are expressions of gentleness <span class="scripture-ref">(Eph 4:32)</span>. Restraint and self-control prove gentleness is a quality of strength. Anyone can react with evil for evil, but only the strong can contain their emotions and calmly control both tongue and body.</p>
          <p>These show a husband's love for his wife. It is a sacrificial love: "as Christ loved the church". It is a preeminent love: "as their own bodies". It is a truly caring love: "even as himself" <span class="scripture-ref">(Eph 5:25-33)</span>.</p>

        <article class="article" id="have-you-been-used">
          <h2>Have You Been Used?</h2>
          <p>Throughout time, men have allowed God to use them as He sees fit for the furtherance of His plan. Men such as David, Elijah, Peter, and John quickly come to mind. Then we consider the countless unnamed who dedicated their lives to service for God. The Hebrew writer mentions ones who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions, quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight <span class="scripture-ref">(Heb. 11:33-34)</span>. The Hebrew writer makes it clear that God was pleased with these men and women because they diligently sought God <span class="scripture-ref">(cf 11:6)</span>. They acted upon their faith. Each Christian must ask, "Am I willing to act upon my faith?" "Am I willing to let God use me?" What kind of man will God use?</p>
          <p><strong>God will use the kind of man who trusts in Him even when the majority is against him.</strong> In <span class="scripture-ref">1 Kings 18</span> Elijah took on 450 prophets of Baal. Did you read that? 450 vs. 1! Lest we forget, Elijah's contest on Mt. Carmel was a huge effort of faith on his part, as evidenced by his prayer: <span class="scripture-ref">"Answer me, O LORD, answer me, that this people may know that You, O LORD, are God, and that You have turned their heart back again." (1 Kings 18:37)</span> God answers Elijah's prayer in the next verse by sending fire. Because of this, the people confessed, "the LORD, He is God." There is a lesson here. We would do well to remember that when it comes to doctrinal truth "one plus God constitutes a majority!" We may compare "big churches" to "little churches" and wrongly conclude that the majority has something we do not. But yet, the majority is often in the wrong. When it comes to teaching and standing for truth—we're not out to win a popularity contest with the world. We're in it to please God and Him only! Let God use you to loudly proclaim His truth!</p>
          <p><strong>God uses those who view problems as opportunities.</strong> Note, we did not say "God uses those who ignore their problems and look for other opportunities." If problems present themselves, personal responsibility dictates that we must deal with them. But, how is our attitude in dealing with such? Remembering God is on our side will help us to have a better outlook on life. Think of Joseph for a moment. In <span class="scripture-ref">Genesis 37:36</span> Joseph has a big problem: being sold into slavery in Egypt. Can you imagine the emotions this man went through on the trip to Egypt? Betrayal, intense anger, worries over his father, and fear are only a few emotions he probably experienced. Joseph never turned his back on God—because <span class="scripture-ref">Genesis 39:2</span> says the Lord was with Joseph, so he became a successful man. Each time a problem presented itself to Joseph; he turned it into an opportunity to glorify God!</p>
          <p><strong>God uses those who make themselves available.</strong> Too many quit before they get started because they feel they are lacking in ability. Each person has his own strengths and weaknesses. Each person can do much for God—in a unique way. You can do all that God wants you to do! Think again of Elijah. How is he described in James' epistle? <span class="scripture-ref">Js. 5:17a</span> tells us he was a man with a nature like ours… But yet he did incredible things for God! He made himself available for God to use Him by looking for opportunities to better serve Him. So should we! If we do, we'll be amazed at what He will accomplish through us. Remember Paul's writing in <span class="scripture-ref">Eph. 3:20</span>: "Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us." God has work for you in His vineyard. No one should overlook the things God places in the pathway of life. Get busy serving Him today and allow Him to go to work in your life! Have you been used?</p>

        <article class="article" id="i-repent">
          <h2>"I Repent"</h2>
          <p>God desires for all men to open their heart to Him. God wants us to walk in the light – to make truth the pattern of our conduct. We are to lay aside the old self …and be renewed in the spirit of your mind, (putting) on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth <span class="scripture-ref">(Eph. 4:22-24)</span>. We must build our lives around the idea that there is nothing more important than pleasing Him. The very essence of our being must be given in love to Him. Think of what Moses said in <span class="scripture-ref">Deut. 10:12</span>: "What does the LORD your God require from you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways and love Him, and to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul."</p>
          <p>This week I had opportunity to encourage a sister in Christ from Ukraine who has been saddled with the burden of teaching since at this time there are no faithful men within the congregation. Only a Christian for ten months, she approached us with some questions about the usage of the church treasury. Being truly interested in doing things in a way that God would be pleased, she explained a situation she was recently confronted with and then inquired as to whether she had acted accordingly. When we explained to her the pattern in the New Testament – she simply said, "I repent." Her honesty and humility were evident to all within the room. There is no doubt this sister stands with her heart open – seeking to do her best for God. Oh how refreshing! Think of it: no arguing, no rationalization; no seeking to justify actions. The words, "I repent" have remained in my mind and thus the inspiration for this article.</p>
          <p>Too often we close our hearts to God because of stubborn pride. This causes us to look for ways to justify our deeds. How often do we approach God's word contrasting His truth to our actions and sincerely determine to correct things amiss? How often do we give into rationalization because of good intentions? When we follow this line of thinking are we truly following Paul's admonition in <span class="scripture-ref">2 Cor. 13:5</span> to test yourselves to see if you are in the faith; examine yourselves? Examination is useless if the heart is not open to change. Remember James' teaching in <span class="scripture-ref">Js. 1:23-24</span>? "For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror; for once he has looked at himself and gone away, he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was." Perhaps this is why Jesus talked about the need to become as little children – putting all trust and faith in Him – as a young child does his parents <span class="scripture-ref">(Mt. 18:3)</span>. If we fail to develop the humble and trusting disposition of a child – Jesus says we will not enter the kingdom of heaven. We must learn to let go of the pride. We all cling to it so tenaciously at times.</p>
          <p>Pride that is not dealt with effectively will lead one away from Christ. How quick are we to pass the blame to others in order to get attention diverted from self? There is little doubt all humans have faced this problem as it goes all the way back to Eden <span class="scripture-ref">(Gen. 3:1-13)</span>. We must remember passages such as <span class="scripture-ref">Romans 14:12</span> - So then each one of us will give an account of himself to God. <span class="scripture-ref">2 Corinthians 5:10</span> emphasizes that one day all will take personal responsibility for the deeds done in the body. We can either take responsibility now to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling <span class="scripture-ref">(Phil. 2:12)</span> or have responsibility laid at our feet at judgment when it is eternally too late.</p>
          <p>Let us be reminded of the example of David when confronted with his sin <span class="scripture-ref">(2 Sam. 12:1-13)</span>. He was cut to the heart. There was nothing to say but, "I have sinned against the Lord." (v. 13). In the Psalms we have the picture of a man whose heart begged for cleansing: <span class="scripture-ref">"Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me. Do not cast me away from Your presence and do not take Your Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of Your salvation and sustain me with a willing spirit." (Ps 51:10-12)</span></p>
          <p>It takes courage to open up one's heart. But it is essential because God knows its contents. Jeremiah said, <span class="scripture-ref">"You know me, O LORD; You see me; and You examine my heart's attitude toward You." (Jer. 12:3)</span> When we open our heart honestly desiring to change for the better it may be painful at first – but eternally worth it. Oh Lord may we learn to put away pride when confronted with wrongdoing and honestly say "I repent." May He find in us a heart that is well pleasing to Him.</p>

        <article class="article" id="book-of-titus">
          <h2>Passing The Sword: The Book Of Titus</h2>
          <h3>Chapter One: Protection Of Sound Doctrine</h3>
          <p>Paul told Titus to put things in order among the churches in Crete. One of the ways to put things in order was through the appointment of elders in every city. The qualifications of elders are mentioned here as well as in <span class="scripture-ref">1 Tim. 3</span>.</p>
          <p>Paul warns Titus to be on guard against false teachers. He says that their mouths must be stopped. Their false teaching was subverting whole households (possibly churches, since many churches in those days were meeting in homes). Faith does not rest upon the ways and ideas of men, but on the Word of God. So, all doctrines were to be judged by the Word of God. These false teachers were to be rebuked sharply, that they might be sound in the faith. Preachers of today are to be aware of false teachers among the flock and are to withstand them to the face for the well-being of the congregation. Actually, this should be done by godly elders. But where there are no elders, or where the elders are not doing their duty along this line, then, many times it falls into the hands of the preacher to withstand false teachers.</p>
          <h3>Chapter Two: Preaching Of Sound Doctrine</h3>
          <p>"Adorn the doctrine". Titus was to teach sound doctrine as to the manner of life among different categories of people. There were the aged men, the aged women, the young women and the young men. The older men were to be sober, reverent, temperate, sound in faith, in love, and in patience. The older women were to also be reverent in behavior, not slanderers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things--that they admonish the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, to be discreet, chaste, homemakers, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be blasphemed by their conduct. Young men were to be sober-minded, in all things showing integrity, reverence, incorruptibility, sound speech that cannot be condemned, that one who is an opponent may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say of you.</p>
          <p>Titus was to also exhort bondservants to be obedient to their own masters, to be well pleasing in all things, not answering back, not pilfering, but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.</p>
          <p>Paul tells Titus that the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present age. Yes, the grace of God has brought salvation to all men. Does this mean that all men will be saved? NO! Notice that this grace of God is a teaching tool. The salvation is found in the gospel of Christ <span class="scripture-ref">(Rom. 1:16,17)</span>. This gospel is the Word of God that has been given unto us by and through the grace of God. This Word of God is the Truth whereby we might be saved <span class="scripture-ref">(Jno. 8:32)</span>. So, we must study it to show ourselves approved unto God and that we might rightly divide the Word <span class="scripture-ref">(2 Tim. 2:15)</span>. Yes, we are saved by the grace of God but only by studying and obeying His word.</p>
          <p>This saving grace was made possible for us by our Savior Jesus Christ, giving Himself for us, that He might redeem us from every lawless deed and purify for Himself His own special people, zealous for good works. These were the things that Titus was to speak, exhorting and rebuking with all authority. He was to conduct himself so that no one could despise him. (vs. 15). He was to conduct himself as all young men were told to conduct themselves. (vss. 6-8). He was to set a good example, have pure motives, be serious in conduct, teach only and all of the truth; so his life, and his speech could withstand the attacks of false teachers. This is a model outline and is always current for any who desire to teach and preach publicly.</p>

        <article class="article" id="godly-wife">
          <h2>"Home" Needs A Godly Wife</h2>
          <p>Continuing our study of the home, look with me again at woman – the counterpart of man, and examine her role as a wife. Holman's Bible Dictionary defines "wife" as: "Female marriage partner" and "husband" as: "The male partner in a marriage." We again conclude the home God designed begins with one male and one female united for life <span class="scripture-ref">(Gen 1:24,25)</span>. <span class="scripture-ref">Proverbs 18:22</span> says "Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing. . . ." A wife's role is one of dignity and honor, not to be looked upon with disdain or thought of as a second class citizen. But what is involved in being a wife according to God's plan?</p>
          <p>Just as the husband, the wife must leave one family relationship in favor of establishing another. <span class="scripture-ref">Matt 19:5,6</span> teaches that the husband must leave father and mother and cleave to his wife, becoming one flesh. It seems reasonable to me that in order for the wife to be joined to her husband like being stuck with glue, (what "cleave" means) she also must leave father and mother. This new relationship must take precedence over any other fleshly relationships. Every wife has obligations to her own family over all others. Marriages suffer when either husband or wife does not leave father and mother.</p>
          <p>The wife's "role" involves subjection to her husband, God's will from the beginning <span class="scripture-ref">". . . and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee." (Gen 3:16)</span>. According to <span class="scripture-ref">Eph 5:22</span> this subjection is to be ". . .as unto the Lord." It involves willful, desirable, beneficial subjection as opposed to assertiveness, dominance or threatening behavior, a role only a Christian can fully appreciate. <span class="scripture-ref">Eph 5:24</span> says wives are to be in subjection in everything, therefore this subjection is comprehensive in nature. At no time, no place, and in no thing is it proper for a wife to NOT be in subjection to her husband, which extends even to unbelieving husbands <span class="scripture-ref">(1 Pet 3:1; 1 Cor 7:13)</span>, with but one exception, as <span class="scripture-ref">Acts 5:29</span> clearly shows, our responsibility to God supersedes all other responsibilities.</p>
          <p>God said it was not good for man to be alone, so he made him a "help meet" <span class="scripture-ref">(Gen 2:18,20)</span>. The "role" of a wife, therefore, involves her being a "help meet" for man. "Help meet" involves compatibility and appropriateness to her husband's needs. She is a compliment to him, suitable for meeting all of his needs. She helps meet his physical needs. Because it was not good for man to be alone, she is his companion. God also designed woman to meet the sexual needs of man, therefore a wife also fulfills or meets those physical needs <span class="scripture-ref">(1 Cor 7:1-4; Heb 13:4)</span>. She helps meet her husband's domestic needs by being a keeper at home <span class="scripture-ref">(Tit 2:5)</span>; guiding the house <span class="scripture-ref">(1 Tim 5:14)</span>; and bearing and caring for children <span class="scripture-ref">(1 Tim 5:14; Prov 31:27)</span>. A wife also helps her husband in spiritual matters. She, by her faithful, godly example can bring her husband to Christ <span class="scripture-ref">(1 Pet 3:1-5; 1 Cor 7:6)</span>.</p>
          <p>The wife's "role" involves respect for her husband <span class="scripture-ref">(Eph 5:33; 1 Pet 3:2)</span>. It involves faithfulness to her husband <span class="scripture-ref">(Prov 31:11,12)</span>. The heart of her husband safely trusts in her. The wife's "role" involves having children <span class="scripture-ref">(Gen 1:28)</span>. She should want to have children; she has been blessed with her ability. Her role does NOT include usurping authority over the man <span class="scripture-ref">(1 Tim 2:11,12; 1 Cor 14:34)</span>. She is not to function as a teacher or leader over men in the church.</p>
          <p>God made woman from man <span class="scripture-ref">(Gen 2:21-23)</span>; woman for man <span class="scripture-ref">(1 Cor 11:9)</span>; but man through woman <span class="scripture-ref">(1 Cor 11:12)</span>. Just as the home needs a godly man who functions as a husband; it needs a godly woman who functions as a wife. When both function scripturally you have a home God designed.</p>
