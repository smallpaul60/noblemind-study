          <h2>And So We Close</h2>
          <p>A little over five years ago my Father-in-Law, Glenn Melton, asked if I would help him with a monthly publication designed to help young men who were interested in spreading the Gospel. In the first issue He stated his reason and purpose for this paper:</p>
          <blockquote>
            Why publish THE STRAITWAY? (1) We have a desire to help others, to do good and no harm. (2) The writing of several men will give variety to the material which will be contained herein. Each one has his own subject area. He will write twelve articles to be published in 1999. In 2000, another group of men will write on another set of subject areas. We think this material will help every thoughtful reader. (3) Many young men have dedicated their lives to proclaiming the unsearchable riches of Christ. To encourage as many as we can in this noble work is our prime purpose. Young preachers should know there are older Christians who appreciate them and are concerned about them, not jealous of them. If the churches of our Lord are to chart a course within the "strait and narrow," they need young preachers who are willing to preach the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Who are more interested in advancing the cause of Christ than anything else. (4) There is truth to be defended and error to be exposed.
            <br><br>— Glenn Melton, Owner & Editor
          </blockquote>
          <p>For three years Glenn held to this course. There were bumps along the way, but with his determination to present these needed lessons, we pushed forward. During the spring and summer of our third year of publication, 2001, Glenn's health began to fail due to cancer. As fall of 2001 came I was given the reins of StraitWay because Glenn's health would not allow him to work as editor. In December of 2001 Glenn passed from this world into the hands of the righteous Judge. Since that time I have been trying to continue this work.</p>
          <p>Glenn had told me that he wanted to at least publish StraitWay through 2003. He felt that there should be a closing point for an effort such as this. Glenn considered the idea of continuing past 2003, but as he passed things to me, there was a definite indication that he wished to end StraitWay at the close of 2003.</p>
          <p>As I began taking over the duties of owner and editor, I began to realize how much of the work Glenn had taken care of himself. While I had taken part in the setup, printing and mailing almost since the beginning, Glenn had taken care of getting subjects and men to write the articles. He had made sure the articles got to me in a timely manner for preparing the paper. Much of the mental tasks he had taken care of without me even knowing it needed to be done.</p>
          <p>During the past five years we have also worked through mechanical failures and health problems among several who help with getting this paper out each month. There have been a few issues skipped or combined because of these difficulties, but we have tried to keep our goals in sight through it all. I hope that the work of our writers has been of benefit to you.</p>
          <p>As Glenn stated in the beginning, our desire has been to help others. If you have been helped with understanding the Will of the Lord, we have been successful in meeting our goal. For five years StraitWay has tried to teach the simple Truth of God's Word on issues that confront Christians and the church. There is still much teaching that can be done in many areas, but we have completed our course with this particular work. Thank you for listening to our message.</p>

          <h2>Hand Clapping in Worship</h2>
          <p>Corruption in worship is nothing new. During Old Testament times we read of Uzziah who met his undoing because of pride. <span class="scripture-ref">"When he became strong, his heart was so proud that he acted corruptly, and he was unfaithful to the LORD his God, for he entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense. Then Azariah the priest entered after him and with him eighty priests of the LORD, valiant men. They opposed Uzziah the king and said to him, 'It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD, but for the priests, the sons of Aaron who are consecrated to burn incense. Get out of the sanctuary, for you have been unfaithful and will have no honor from the LORD God.'" (2 Chron 26:16-18)</span> In the next few verses we read of Uzziah's temper getting the best of him. God struck him with leprosy and he spent the rest of his life in disgrace. Uzziah sinned when he flagrantly disregarded God's prescribed law on how He was to be worshiped.</p>
          <p>Just as in Old Testament times, God has laid out specifics on how He desires to be worshiped by Christians living under the law of Christ. However, the religious world has demonstrated a great desire to tinker around with the worship service. The motive is to make things more relevant for modern generations. Scriptural worship practices are now viewed as a mere "tradition" thus giving an opening for change. The worship service is changed into nothing more than a performance to stimulate emotions and to seek the observer's gratification through entertainment. Some are driven by a religion that is better felt than told.</p>
          <p>One notable change that has come about is hand clapping during worship. Most often this occurs as applause following baptisms, sermons, and singing. Is this a modern form of saying "Amen" as some claim? Does God approve of applause in a worship service? One bible dictionary defines "Amen" as a word used "to affirm and confirm a statement." "It is often used to confirm the words of another and adds for the wish for success to another's vow or prediction." We usually say "Amen" after a prayer. Others have been known to say it during the middle of a sermon – indicating their wholehearted agreement with the message preached. Note that the use of "Amen" in the bible focuses upon the message rather than the person presenting the message. Applause is most often directed toward the person. Hand clapping during worship takes the focus off the message and places it on the person!</p>
          <p>There is danger when moving the focus from the message to the messenger. Those who would approve of applause during worship must answer: Would persons applaud when the content is not appealing? Would they applaud when the speaker struggles to relate Biblical truth in the most elegant way? I like Bill Lockwood's comments where he writes, "People have no real reason for clapping in worship other than that they are being pushed around by cultural currents which turns worship into performance-oriented acting instead of bowing before God's throne."</p>
          <p>When getting down to the basics, this matter should be determined on the basis of biblical authority. Yes, there are a few Old Testament passages which mention clapping <span class="scripture-ref">(Psa. 47:1-2; Psa. 98:4-9)</span> but one can justify the practice from these passages as much as he can justify instrumental music in worship. For those who wish to justify the practice using these scriptures, they must also look to <span class="scripture-ref">Job 27:23; 34:37; Lam. 2:15; Ezek. 25:6; and Nahum 3:19</span>. Observe that hand clapping in all these references point to it being used to demonstrate hostility or contempt. Dave Miller rightly asks, "Will the advocates of hand clapping in the worship assembly urge this use of hand clapping, along with boos, hisses, and catcalls?" The New Testament is silent on the matter. There is no example, direct command, or inference found concerning applause. Therefore today's Christian should refrain from using it in the worship service.</p>
          <p>Remember, worship is all about God – and pleasing Him. <span class="scripture-ref">"But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for such people the Father seeks to be His worshipers. God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth." (John 4:23-24)</span></p>

          <h2>Passing The Sword: Second Timothy</h2>
          <p>This is the last article that I will be presenting to StraitWay. I want to thank brother Henderson for allowing me to write for his paper during the course of this year. I have enjoyed it and hope that I have been of some help to someone that has read my articles. I look forward to reading from StraitWay during the following year.</p>
          <h3>Chapter Three</h3>
          <p>In the first nine verses of this chapter Paul tells Timothy about the dangers of apostasy. One reason that Paul is writing is the perils that threaten the church. He sadly foresees the churches being invaded by godlessness and worldliness. The same thing applies, maybe even more so today.</p>
          <p>Verses 10-17 tells of the defense against apostasy. Timothy is told to follow Paul's example. Persecution is sure to come when we resist the Devil <span class="scripture-ref">(Matt. 5:10-12; Acts 14:22)</span>. The Bible is the one effective antidote against apostasy and corruption. Timothy presents himself as an excellent example for young people in every generation. Love the Lord and dedicate yourself to Him. This will help you to overcome all fears and handicaps that might come your way.</p>
          <p>Verses 16 and 17 tell about the inspiration of the Bible, that it is a divine production, breathed out by God. The Holy Spirit guided the speaking and writing of the Word of God <span class="scripture-ref">(Acts 2:4; 1 Cor. 2:9-13; 14:37)</span>. Thus Timothy was equipped with all that he needed to spread the Word of God. We too, that have a good working knowledge of the Word of God are well equipped for every good work.</p>
          <p>These two verses of Scripture furnish Doctrine, Reproof, Correction and Instruction which is in righteousness.</p>
          <h3>Chapter Four</h3>
          <p>Verses 1-5 is the closing exhortation to Timothy. It is the final charge for Timothy to preach sound doctrine. Paul knew his life would soon end, and that he probably would not see Timothy again. He summarizes Timothy's work, and charges him to preach the Word at all times in spite of opposition. As in Timothy's case, so it is the work of every teacher to build his character by the Scriptures. The church flourishes on the pure Word of God; nothing else can take its place. Men do their work and pass on, but the Word abides forever. It is the responsibility of the faithful in every generation to teach God's Word faithfully, until the victory is won. No human being is wise enough, smart enough, impressive enough, or funny enough, to do otherwise and be right.</p>
          <p>Verses 6-8: Paul's triumphant faith is here beautifully expressed in what has been called "His valedictory." The battle-scarred old warrior was looking back over the long, hard fight of many years of total commitment. He was to be executed without guilt on his part. Now he was forsaken by friends and was suffering alone. But there is no hint of regret that he had given his life to Christ without reservation <span class="scripture-ref">(Phil. 1:21-23)</span>.</p>
          <p>Verses 9-18: Some of Paul's friends had gone out on special missions: some had deserted him. Only Luke stayed with him; Paul desired to see Timothy and Mark once more. Note Paul's desire, even in his last hours, for reading material. No details are given about his final suffering and death. It seems that no one but the Lord was there to support him at his first trial. Was everything lost? Not for him, and not for us if we can see far enough ahead.</p>
          <p>Verses 19-22: His concluding greetings and benediction. Things in this epistle which are said to belong to us in Him: 1:1 – The promise of Life. 1:9 – Salvation through God's purpose and grace. 1:13 – Faith and love. 2:1 – Strength through divine grace. 2:10 – Salvation. 3:12 – Persecution for godly living. 3:15 – Salvation through faith. 4:8 – The crown of righteousness.</p>

        <article class="article" id="church-jesus-built">
          <h2>The Church That Jesus Built</h2>
          <h3>What Jesus Built</h3>
          <p>In studying what Jesus promised and built, we learn that God's people composed the church. The people that He had so long sought through Old Testament times and arrangements were now built upon the foundation that He himself had laid. Different figures used in the New Testament teach us what Jesus built.</p>
          <p>From the standpoint of their loyalty to God, His people were the family of God, made up of spiritual children <span class="scripture-ref">(1 Tim. 3:15)</span>. From the viewpoint of their privileges and responsibilities under the reign of Christ, they are citizens in the spiritual kingdom <span class="scripture-ref">(Col. 1:13)</span>. As people married to Christ and demonstrating their allegiance to Him, they are His bride <span class="scripture-ref">(2 Cor. 11:2; Eph. 5:22-32)</span>. In their relation to Christ as master and teacher, those in the church are disciples and Christians <span class="scripture-ref">(Acts 11:26)</span>. In their connection with each other, they sometimes are portrayed as members of a body headed by Christ <span class="scripture-ref">(Eph. 1:23)</span>. As those empowered to serve and worship God for themselves, apart from human mediation, Christians are priests in the holy priesthood <span class="scripture-ref">(1 Pet. 2:5)</span>.</p>
          <p>What Jesus did on Pentecost in beginning the church, He continues to do by the same means of gospel preaching and obedience on the part of individuals <span class="scripture-ref">(1 Pet. 2:5)</span>. The work of redemption, finalized in Christ's work, must be applied to individuals through the work of preaching the gospel. As long as people are responding in faith to the gospel, living stones "are being built" into the spiritual house (NKJB rendering of Peter's verse). The spiritual house begun on that memorable Pentecost is an unfinished work, because the Lord's delay of His coming means more souls can be saved <span class="scripture-ref">(2 Pet. 3:15)</span>.</p>
          <h3>Government of the Church</h3>
          <p>When Jesus spoke of the kingdom of heaven, He alluded to that which had brought Him to earth and which both He and His predecessor John had announced as being near. "Kingdom" often conveys its basic meaning of reign or dominion, but here Jesus most likely referred to the church as being interchangeable with the kingdom. Jesus began His reign upon His return to heaven and later began the church when Peter used the keys of the kingdom to open the church to human beings. The government of the Lord's church is that of a kingdom, because Christ is king over this spiritual realm.</p>
          <p>Lee Woodward, a close friend and fellow-teacher, frequently told his new classes at the beginning of the school year that his classroom was not a democracy, but a dictatorship. He simply meant that he was the one in charge in the classroom, not that he ruled as a tyrant. All need to understand that Jesus is in charge in the church. The church is not governed by an oligarchy, a democracy, or an aristocracy. Neither the majority nor the minority rules the church; Jesus does! He is king, raised from the dead and exalted to His position by God the Father <span class="scripture-ref">(Acts 13:32-39)</span>. Those in His church have willingly accepted His rule.</p>
          <p>In the New Testament the kingship of Jesus is equated with His role as Lord <span class="scripture-ref">(Acts 2:36)</span> and head of the church <span class="scripture-ref">(Eph. 5:23)</span>. In all three of these varied expressions—king, head, and Lord, the central idea is that of His authority. The idea of a king stresses His rule over His people. The image of a head emphasizes His control of the members of His body. The word "Lord" focuses on His position as master over His servants. One cannot be in the church apart from surrendering his own will to that of Christ.</p>
          <p>Inherent in Christ's plan for His people in local churches is the role of a plurality of elders, but they must not act as lords over God's heritage <span class="scripture-ref">(1 Pet. 5:3)</span>. As examples and wise spiritual leaders, they "stand before" the sheep to show them the way and to teach them to follow. In their oversight there are judgment decisions that they must make, but even here they should consider the needs, wishes, and welfare of the church, not their own selfish desires. In this respect they submit first to Christ and then to their fellow-Christians. Elders are not a part of the government in the sense that Jesus is, for they share no legislative power with Him. They do, however, occupy a very important role in the functioning of a local church.</p>

        <article class="article" id="haven-for-children">
          <h2>"Home" — A Haven For Children</h2>
          <p>In many "so called" homes today children are being thrown away, literally through abortion and outright murder, and figuratively through abandonment and neglect of parental responsibilities. In previous articles we have discussed the various "roles" and responsibilities that are incumbent on the male and female ("the man and his wife" <span class="scripture-ref">Gen 1:25</span>) that forms the beginning of the home as God designed it <span class="scripture-ref">Gen 2:23,24</span>. Now we must take some time to discuss the children that result from the man and woman being joined together and becoming "one flesh" i.e. husband and wife - father and mother.</p>
          <p>David by inspiration said: <span class="scripture-ref">"Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward." (Psalms 127:3)</span>. The word "heritage" is something given by someone else and in this case the "giver" is God. Yet children, in many instances today are treated like anything but a gift from God.</p>
          <p>If fathers and mothers fulfill their responsibilities according to God's will, home becomes a "haven for children". Webster defines "haven" as: "a place of safety or a place offering favorable opportunities or conditions." Home is the institution God designed to care for and train children. They are to be brought up <span class="scripture-ref">"in the training and admonition of the Lord." (Eph. 6:4 NKJV)</span>. Jesus grew and developed in four areas: wisdom, stature, favor with man and favor with God <span class="scripture-ref">(Lk. 2:52)</span>, that is, He grew mentally, physically, socially and spiritually.</p>
          <p>In regard to growth in these four areas, let me share with you some thoughts from John Clark's booklet "STUDIES IN FAMILY LIFE": "Mental development can result in good education to be used in the service of God or can result in pride and arrogance that honors self and has no room for God. Physical development can result in good health, athletic ability, etc. And an understanding of our 'maleness' or 'femaleness' that will honor God; or it can result in an obsession with the body, physical attractiveness and misuse of the body in lust and licentiousness. Social development can develop in us an understanding and appreciation of people that will help us in reaching them and influencing them with the gospel or it can create in us a craze for popularity – a desire to go along with the crowd – that will influence us to sell our principles cheaply. Spiritual development creates a desire to please God and go to heaven. It develops young men and women for service to Christ. When this is neglected the religion of Jesus is meaningless."</p>
          <p>Home is the primary place where this training takes place. Yes, parents may utilize social institutions such as schools, athletic programs, medical facilities, etc. to help facilitate training and growth that must occur in the mental, physical and social development of a child. Parents may also use the teaching opportunities provided by a local congregation of the Lord's people, the church, to help in the spiritual growth that must also occur. However, even though these may be used to help parents fulfill their responsibilities, remember "home" is the haven for children and not these various social institutions, nor even the church. When proper love, care, concern and training is exercised children will have fond memories of their "growing up years" and will be the kind of people that God would have them be.</p>
          <p>Yes, young people, home is a "haven", a place of safety that offers favorable opportunities or conditions for your development. Yet, you are not without responsibility in this "haven". <span class="scripture-ref">Eph. 6:1, 2</span> says: "Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)". So, children have the responsibility to obey and honor their parents. The very next verse (4) is the one that places the responsibility of training and development primarily on fathers and other passages show that mothers share in this responsibility. The phrase "in the Lord" means according to the will of the Lord. God's will can never be set aside in favor of man's will <span class="scripture-ref">(Acts 5:29)</span>. However, godly parents will not knowingly require something of their children that is not according to God's will.</p>
          <p>In order for home to be a "haven" for children, parents must acknowledge and fulfill their God given responsibilities in teaching and training their children and children must recognize their responsibility to obey and honor their parents.</p>

        <article class="article" id="like-the-dew">
          <h2>Like the Dew that Goes Away Early</h2>
          <p>We read of Hosea only in his book. His name means "deliverance" or "salvation." Hosea served as one of the prophets to Israel in the 8th century BC. His was a time of great prosperity – under Jeroboam II (793-753 BC) Israel reached its greatest peak in worldly wealth, power, and position. Many Israelites grew accustomed to the easy life and were either unaware or uncaring about the moral and spiritual bankruptcy their nation experienced. Idol worship was common in the land – and those who served the Lord did so out of mere tradition. Their hearts were far from the Lord. It is in this environment that Hosea was directed to marry a wife of harlotry <span class="scripture-ref">(1:2)</span>. It is through Gomer's disloyalty to Hosea that we get an intimate detail of the hurt God experienced because of Israel's spiritual adultery.</p>
          <p>In chapter 6 God uses Hosea to express His displeasure with Israel. <span class="scripture-ref">"What shall I do with you, O Ephraim? What shall I do with you, O Judah? For your loyalty is like a morning cloud and like the dew which goes away early." (Hos. 6:4)</span> Time and time again Israel repented, turned away from its idols, and served God only to fall away a generation or two later. Perhaps the greatest problem leading to their continual backsliding was the absence of a genuine relationship with God. <span class="scripture-ref">"For I delight in loyalty rather than sacrifice, And in the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings." (Hos. 6:6)</span></p>
          <p>Hosea's message is clear in stating that the patience of God had run its course. In what must have seemed like a message out of touch with his society – Hosea says <span class="scripture-ref">"for they sow the wind and they reap the whirlwind." (8:7)</span> Imagine how this message must have sounded to a society of people at ease - living in luxurious homes with plenty of money to go around - trusting in the massive numbers of their army to protect them. <span class="scripture-ref">"Though I wrote for him ten thousand precepts of My law, they are regarded as a strange thing." (8:12)</span> Hosea warned of how compassion would be hidden from God's sight <span class="scripture-ref">(13:4)</span>. And, how quickly Israel did fall – within thirty years of Jeroboam II's death – Assyria would take the northern ten tribes into captivity.</p>
          <p>Nothing has changed. God desires a real, meaningful relationship with people today! He wants our undivided loyalty! He still requires us <span class="scripture-ref">"to do justice, to love kindness, and to walk humbly with (our) God." (Micah 6:8)</span>. Jesus explained that we should love Him with all our heart, soul, and mind! <span class="scripture-ref">(Mt. 22:36-37)</span> Can we say with Paul, <span class="scripture-ref">"I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me." (Gal. 2:20)</span>?</p>
          <p>How often is our loyalty "like the dew which goes away early?" True loyalty will require us to give our heart to Him! God wants us to love Him! It is only then that our actions will mean something to Him. Many never get anything out of their Christianity because of their unwillingness to have nothing more than a shallow, superficial relationship offering only the minimums. Some will realize only too late that one cannot go to heaven with only the least amount of service. This is the lesson the Israelites of Hosea's day failed to learn.</p>
          <p>There is little doubt that God desired a special relationship with Israel. God says through Hosea, <span class="scripture-ref">"When Israel was a youth I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son. It is I who taught Ephraim to walk, I took them in my arms; but they did not know that I healed them. I led them with cords of a man, with bonds of love, and I became to them as one who lifts the yoke from their jaws; and I bent down and fed them." (Hosea 11:1, 3-4)</span> Yet, Israel was bent on turning from God and it caused Him to say, "my heart is turned over within Me." <span class="scripture-ref">(11:8)</span></p>
          <p>Just as God desired a special relationship with Israel – He desires a relationship with mankind today. Through Jesus' death it is possible for us to bridge the gap and serve God with confidence! This is why He has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness. This is why He has granted to us His precious and magnificent promises. He wants us to be partakers of the divine nature and escape the corruption that is in the world by lust <span class="scripture-ref">(2 Pet. 1:3-4)</span>. Everyone has an opportunity to take advantage of God's free gift.</p>
          <p>Develop the kind of relationship with God while you have opportunity. One day God's patience will expire and all outside of Christ will be lost. <span class="scripture-ref">"Whoever is wise, let him understand these things; whoever is discerning, let him know them, for the ways of the Lord are right, and the righteous will walk in them, but transgressors will stumble in them." (Hosea 14:9)</span></p>
