        <h2>Overseeing The Flock: Part Two - Things Elders Wonder About</h2>

        <p>Elders have to wonder how those that attend worship once or twice a month decide when to attend? Just what makes them decide when they get up in the morning to say, "This is the Sunday I will go to church?" "I haven't been in about a month now and I suppose it is time." Just what is different about that particular Sunday compared to all the others they miss?</p>

        <p>Elders have to wonder how one chooses which headache is a church headache and which one is a work headache? How do some people determine that a headache is not bad enough to miss work, but yet it is bad enough to miss worship? Do they think God will overlook their absence, but their employer will not?</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is..." (<span class="scripture-ref">Heb 10:25</span>)</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Elders have to wonder what folks are thinking when they look in the mirror before going to worship and see their top half almost exposed because their top is too low cut, sleeveless, or backless? And, when they look at the hem of their dress and see that when they sit down it will uncover their thigh, do you suppose they have some special thoughts?</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"In like manner also, the women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety..." (<span class="scripture-ref">1st Tim. 2:9</span>)</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Elders have to wonder what Christians are thinking when they rent an "R" rated movie? Have you wondered what they were thinking when they were telling you how bad it was, and how it would have been better if certain parts had been left out? Why should they have been surprised when they were exposed to nudity, foul language, and violence? That is what "R" rated movies have in them, and it is no secret.</p>

        <p>Elders have to wonder how so many of the brethren know the names of all the soap stars? How do they know so much about the so-called comedies that have plots exploiting drinking, sex, divorce, adultery, and homosexuality? Yet, many of these same folks can't remember who many of the Bible characters are and what they did.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things." (<span class="scripture-ref">Phil. 4:8</span>)</p>

        <h2>Preacher Training: The Program Itself</h2>

        <p>In this series we're looking at the training of preachers from the standpoint of a congregational effort. In our last installment we talked about why such a program is both Biblical and expedient. This time I'd like to offer a few comments on the program itself.</p>

        <p>There are any number of ways that preacher training programs are being carried on today. Many churches have engaged in <strong>summer training programs</strong>. This allows some writing and bulletin work as well as some time in the pulpit to hone speaking skills. The time constraint of this effort however, usually does not allow a great deal of time for starting from "scratch" or ironing out doctrinal matters or personal conflicts.</p>

        <p>I know of a <strong>two week program</strong> where literally hundreds of men have attended and profited by a short, intensive fellowship of daily classes, lectures, and assignments. As good as it is, the down-side can be shown by asking any high schooler how much they remember when they 'cram' for a test.</p>

        <p>Do I have a favorite? I believe that a <strong>year long program</strong> is one of the best choices for accomplishing the goal of preparing a man for this work. A Paul-Timothy arrangement for a year is both biblical and expedient. In three months a man will pretty much know all the members in a large congregation, but in 6 months he will "begin" to know the problems they wrestle with. In nine or 10 months there is an excellent chance that he would have been involved enough to even help some through a difficult time.</p>

        <p>I like the working aspect of an "intern" relationship in this matter of training. An intern in a hospital is one who definitely is a doctor, but he is supervised. We always had an arrangement that if anyone had a problem with him, they were NOT to go directly to him, but to me. And if the young man had a problem, he was NOT to jump up and preach about it, but come to me. If there was correcting to be done (and there was!) then I could do that privately, over a cup of coffee, on Monday morning.</p>

        <h2>Passing The Sword: Timothy - A Servant From His Youth</h2>

        <p>Solomon says that we should seek the Creator in the days of our youth (<span class="scripture-ref">Eccl. 12:1</span>). It seems that the older we get the more set in our ways we become and our hearts lose the flexibility that they once had.</p>

        <p>Timothy was born in the area of Lycaonia, of the Roman province of Galatia, now known as Turkey, in the city of Lystra, in about 25-30 A.D. His father was a Greek or Gentile and his mother was a devout Jew (<span class="scripture-ref">Acts 16:1</span>). Even though his mother, Eunice, and grandmother, Lois, are named, his father nor grandfather are.</p>

        <p>The first mention that we have of Timothy is found at the beginning of Paul's second journey (<span class="scripture-ref">Acts 15:40,41; 16:1</span>). Paul and Barnabas had been to Lystra on the first journey, when many notable things happened to them (<span class="scripture-ref">Acts 14:6-23</span>). This first journey took place between 46 and 48 A.D., which would mean that Timothy would have been in his early 20's at the time.</p>

        <p>It seems that Timothy had progressed well during the intervening time between the first and second journeys (<span class="scripture-ref">Acts 16:2</span>). This could be expected since he had been well-taught from his early childhood by his mother and grandmother (<span class="scripture-ref">2 Tim. 3:14,15; 1:3-5</span>).</p>

        <p>When Paul and Silas came to Lystra on the second journey, about 49-52 A.D., Paul wanted Timothy to join him in the work of the Lord (<span class="scripture-ref">Acts 16:1-3</span>). No doubt, Paul could see qualities in this young man that would be of great service to him and to the Lord in the days to come. From what we learn from the writings of both Luke and Paul the choice was certainly a good one.</p>

        <p>Seemingly, Timothy stands out as one of the very best (<span class="scripture-ref">Phil. 2:19-23</span>). Paul refers to him as: "my beloved son" and "my true son in the faith".</p>

        <h2>The Deacon's Work: Responsibilities</h2>

        <p>In <span class="scripture-ref">Philippians 1:1</span> Paul addresses the letter to the church, "To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the bishops and deacons." This passage shows us that the deacons are set apart from or addressed differently than the other saints and the elders. If they are addressed differently I believe we can see that the deacons have different qualifications and responsibilities than the elders or the other saints.</p>

        <p><strong>The first responsibility is one of being a leader in the congregation.</strong> A deacon does not have authority over others in the church and others are not to submit to deacons as they are to elders (<span class="scripture-ref">Hebrews 13:17</span>). Deacons, though, are leaders of another sort. Deacons must be leaders in their example.</p>

        <p>I believe the most important area the deacon should be an example is in submission to, or support of the elders. If the deacons do not support or submit themselves to the elders how will they persuade the others in the church to be submissive? This does not mean the deacon will always agree on every decision the elders make on matters of judgment. Yet this does mean that once a decision is made the deacon has a responsibility to stand behind the elders and give one hundred percent in implementing the idea or project involved.</p>

        <p><strong>Another area where the deacon should be an example is in attending the gathering of the saints.</strong> The New Testament is full of passages that tell us we should meet together and build each other up (<span class="scripture-ref">Hebrews 10:24-25; Colossians 3:16; Ephesians 5:19</span>). If the leadership of a church does not find it necessary to assemble on Sunday night worship or midweek bible study why would we expect the members to make it a priority in their life?</p>

        <p><strong>Another area that deacons must be an example is in completing the tasks that are assigned to them.</strong> When it is required for a deacon to have help in fulfilling his function he should take the lead and show others a willingness to work in order to have others work with him. A deacon who wants to delegate everything that is assigned to him is not fulfilling his responsibility.</p>

        <h2>"Home": God's First Institution</h2>

        <p>The Bible begins with these words: "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth" (<span class="scripture-ref">Gen 1:1</span>). Later in the chapter (v. 27): "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them." Then the text says: "And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him" (<span class="scripture-ref">Gen 2:18</span>).</p>

        <p>Since there was not found a help "meet" for man among all the creatures on earth, God made from one of Adam's ribs a woman and "brought her unto the man" (v 22). Now, note <span class="scripture-ref">Gen 2:23, 24</span>: "And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh."</p>

        <p>In leaving father and mother there is a relationship that must be severed, the man/woman are no longer under the authority of father and mother. The word "leave" means to forsake completely, "to abandon". Certainly, this does not negate the command to "honor" father and mother (<span class="scripture-ref">Matt 15:4</span>), but rather, emphasizes the need for one who takes a mate to renounce the "rule" or "authority" of their parents over this new "home" or "household" being brought into existence.</p>

        <p>The word "cleave" comes from a Greek word which means: 1) to glue upon, glue to; 2) to join one's self to closely, cleave to, stick to (Thayer). This emphasizes the permanency of marriage, it is until death parts them (<span class="scripture-ref">Rom 7:1,2; 1 Cor 7:39</span>). When this "leaving" and "cleaving" takes place, the man (husband) and his wife become one flesh, that is, they are joined together by God; and Jesus said: "What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder" (<span class="scripture-ref">Matt 19:6</span>).</p>

        <h2>Foreign Evangelism: Rekindling The Fire</h2>

        <p>I have become convinced that there are not many more things that can energize an evangelist in his work than foreign evangelism. I encourage all young preachers to jump on the opportunity when it is presented! 1998 was a tough year in my work as a preacher. As that year dragged on, there were times I seriously considered whether or not I needed to be preaching. During the summer and early fall, men close to me encouraged me to help out with work in Central America. What I would experience during that trip has galvanized my work as an evangelist.</p>

        <p><strong>I learned and experienced the true power of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</strong> After teaching the gospel in Belize not once did I hear, "that's just your interpretation" or "we're all trying to get to heaven - your way is OK and so is mine." How refreshing! For the most part, I found people to be humble. They understand the Bible is of God and they know to be pleasing to God one must do what the Bible says. They are hungry for Biblical truth!</p>

        <p><strong>I learned that the approach many institutional brethren use in spreading the gospel does not work.</strong> Numerous efforts such as food banks, medical campaigns, and other social programs have been attempted. Although good is accomplished with the health and welfare of the people, not much is accomplished on the spiritual front. We must realize the power of the gospel is not in medical campaigns, food banks, and social gatherings, but in pure and simple bible teaching!</p>

        <p><strong>I conducted more personal Bible Studies over seventeen days in Belize than some do over the course of a year in America!</strong> Most people were ready to study at anytime. It was quite common to walk into someone's yard, ask if they were interested in studying the bible, and see them stop whatever they were doing to discuss the Scriptures!</p>

        <p><strong>Sundays were days of joyful worship to God!</strong> When meeting for worship in Belize, we assembled outside. It was hot, humid, and uncomfortable. Mosquitoes are a BIG problem! Some brethren walked or rode their bicycle as many as 5-10 miles to worship services - getting up very early in the morning to make it in time for worship! And yet, not one complaint!</p>

        <h2>Trees Found, Forest Missing</h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it." <span class="scripture-ref">Matthew 13:45-46</span></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The verses above teach us a very important lesson regarding value. From them we learn that if we value something greatly we will be willing to give up all we have to attain it. When we understand the value of Christ and His way we will leave all we have on earth to follow Him.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately we may have difficulty helping people understand the lesson taught in these verses and many others found in Scripture. In studying we can become distracted trying to determine what is represented by each part of a particular lesson.</p>

        <p>Most all of us have heard of someone who "can't see the forest for the trees." I think we are guilty of that when studying God's word at times. We spend so much time trying to match each detail to something in our experience that we miss the overall message being taught.</p>

        <p>Let's look at the forest and not get lost in the trees. God wants us to value His truth above all else. When we find that truth we should be willing to sacrifice all we have to gain it. That's the message. Let's not complicate it.</p>
