# Principles of The Noble Mind Study Tool

> *"Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so."*  
> — Acts 17:11 (NASB)

## The Name

The name "Noble Mind" comes from the Bereans described in Acts 17. When Paul preached to them, they didn't simply accept or reject his teaching based on preference, tradition, or the authority of the speaker. Instead, they **received the word with eagerness** and then **examined the Scriptures daily** to verify whether what they were being taught was actually true.

This is the spirit this tool is designed to serve: eager reception of God's word combined with careful, daily examination of Scripture.

## Foundational Principles

### 1. Scripture Interprets Scripture

The Bible is its own best interpreter. When seeking to understand any passage, we look to:

1. **Immediate context** — the verses, paragraphs, and chapters surrounding the text
2. **Cross-references** — other passages that address the same topic or use the same language
3. **The broader testimony of Scripture** — the unified message of the whole Bible

We do not impose meanings from outside Scripture. We let the Bible define its own terms and explain its own concepts.

### 2. Biblical Authority Over Human Tradition

Man is fallible; God's word is not.

When there is a conflict between what Scripture says and what religious tradition teaches, Scripture takes precedence. The Bereans were praised precisely because they tested even an apostle's teaching against the written word. We should do no less with any human teacher, commentary, creed, or tradition.

*"But in vain do they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the precepts of men."* — Matthew 15:9

### 3. The CENI Framework

Sound biblical interpretation recognizes that God communicates His will through:

- **Commands** — Direct instructions from God
- **Examples** — Approved patterns of action in Scripture
- **Necessary Inferences** — Conclusions that must logically follow from what Scripture teaches

This framework helps distinguish between what God has authorized and what is merely human preference or invention.

### 4. Rightly Dividing the Word

*"Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth."* — 2 Timothy 2:15

We recognize the distinction between:

- **The Old Testament** (Law of Moses) — given to Israel, fulfilled in Christ
- **The New Testament** (Law of Christ) — the authority for the church today

While all Scripture is profitable for teaching (2 Timothy 3:16-17), Christians live under Christ's law, not Moses' law (Galatians 6:2, Hebrews 8:13).

### 5. Logic and Evidence Over Consensus

Truth is not determined by majority vote or popular opinion. We follow the evidence of Scripture wherever it leads, even when that contradicts widely-held assumptions.

This applies to:
- Religious questions (testing all teaching against Scripture)
- Origins questions (examining assumptions, following observational evidence)
- Any truth claim (testing it by sound logic and available evidence)

*"Test all things; hold fast what is good."* — 1 Thessalonians 5:21

## Preferred Study Text

While this tool supports multiple Bible translations, the **New American Standard Bible (NASB)** is the preferred text for study due to its commitment to formal equivalence (word-for-word translation philosophy) and its accuracy in rendering the original languages.

---

## The Mission

This tool exists to help Bible students:

1. **Create and organize** Bible study materials
2. **Examine the Scriptures** systematically and carefully
3. **Verify what is taught** against the word of God
4. **Grow in knowledge** of God's will

It is offered **freely** to individuals and congregations, reflecting the principle that God's word and the tools to study it should be accessible to all.

*"Freely you received, freely give."* — Matthew 10:8

## Acknowledgments

This tool was developed with deep appreciation for those who have modeled and taught the "Scripture interprets Scripture" approach, particularly those in the churches of Christ who have faithfully called people back to the Bible as the sole authority in religion.

Special thanks to Brother Freddie Anderson, whose teaching ministry exemplified the approach of asking, "Let's see what the Bible says about it" — and then actually letting the Bible answer.
